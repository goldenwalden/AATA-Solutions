\subsection*{Problem 29}
\noindent Since the number of generators of $\mathbf{Z}_n$ is $\phi(n)$, and $\phi(nm) = \phi(n) \phi(m)$, we have $\phi(m^k) = m^k - m^{k - 1}$ for any prime $k$. Therefore, $\phi(n)$ is even for all $n \geq 3$ and $\mathbf{Z}_n$ has an even number of generators for $n > 2$.
