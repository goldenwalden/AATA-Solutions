\subsection*{Problem 30}
\noindent Suppose that there exist $p < m$, $q < n$ such that $a^p = b^q \neq e$, we have $b^{qm} = a^{pm} = e = b^n$. Since $\abs{b} = n$, we conclude that $n | qm$. And we can also conclude that $m | pn$ in the same way. It controdicts $gcd($m$, $n$) = 1$. Thus, $\langle a \rangle \cup \langle b \rangle = \{e\}$.
