\subsection*{Problem 28}
\noindent This problem equivalent the problem "Let $p \geq 2$, if $p$ is not prime, so is $2^p - 1$" \\
Since $p$ is not prime, there exist $k \neq 1$ such that $k | p$. Now we can think that $2^p - 1 = (111...1)_2$, a $p$-bit binary number. Therefore, we have $2^k - 1 | 2^p - 1$, since $(\underbrace{111...1}_\text{$k$-bits}) | (\underbrace{111...1}_\text{$p$-bits})$. So $2^p - 1$ is not a prime.
