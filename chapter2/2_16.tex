\subsection*{Problem 16}
\noindent Suppose $a$ and $b$ are not relatively prime, there exist a $k$ such that $k | a$, $k | b$ and $k \neq 1$. Therefore, we have
\begin{equation} \notag
	ar + bs = kpr + kqs = k(pr + qs) = 1
\end{equation}
So we have $k | 1$. It is controdict $k \neq 1$. So $a$ and $b$ are relateively prime.
